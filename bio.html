                                                        <br> The Zimbabwean star and optimist ,Emegy Slyvesta Chizanga (Freeman) was born on the 22nd of June in 1988 in Bindura as a last born in a family of 6. Freeman attended Primary school at Nyarukunda
                                                        , pursued his education further and completed his Ordinary level at Chipadze high School. His Musical journey started in school where he was part of the choir. However, he did not take it seriously
                                                        then as this was just an extra mural activity to pass time, little did he know it was going to define his destiny. He only realized his talent when he recorded his first track “Unondipa Rudo”.
                                                        <br> <br> As a keen soccer player with considerable talent in the sport, his focus was more on the game of which he was then selected to play for his senior soccer team in high school at a very tender
                                                        age which is where the nick name “Freeman” came from. His passion and skill in soccer saw him playing for Mwana Africa in Zimbabwe’s first division league at the time. Seeing that soccer was not
                                                        giving him the desired return on investment due to poor funding in the sport at the time, He moved to Harare to stay with his brother. Since he had a passion for music, eventually he recorded his
                                                        first track in November 2009 which was produced by Isaac Jack aka WeMaNuff Nhubu. Inspired by Trinta and Decibel, he continued to record more tracks as an underground artist recorded Unondipa Rudo,Ellen,Mapatya,Mhuka
                                                        nhatu,Murondatsimba,Handichakuda and Ndoda.
                                                        <br><br> His biggest break came with the release of his track “Joina City” which was inspired by a place called Joina City in Dubai. This song became an anthem, playing in every emergency taxi, on
                                                        the radio and every party in the city. He met Dj Staera in 2010 and was introduced to Hillary Mutake the CEO and Founder of Punchline Entertainment after which he started doing public perfomances,
                                                        the first one being in December at a high school in Banket. From then, he continued to play in several places and people showed appreciation and love for his music. In 2011 he released his first
