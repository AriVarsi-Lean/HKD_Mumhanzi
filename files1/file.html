                        For the years I have served in the HKD kraal / family, with a heavy heart, I would want to say,
                         If it were not for the family, fans and friends behind HKD, all my efforts would have been in vain hence 
                         i would not be where i am today. Legalism says, God will love us if we change, but the gospel says, 
                         God will change us because he loves us. I confess. Personally, I've been changed through the grace of God.
                          My scars changed to stars. I travailed until I prevailed. It is never easy to be in a family where parents are six feet under. 
                           I salute my brothers, my sisters and my relatives for having stood by me even when the worst seemed worse.
                            It has taught me that behind storms, there is rainbow. It is my dream to sow love where there is hatred; 
                            to sow faith where there is doubt;
                            to sow hope where there is despair and to sow light where there is darkness. Besides being a singer, I have a heart for 
                            my community  (Dangerzone) ...UP UP UP LIKE THE SKY^^^ MUSATIBATEEE!!! Well, fortunately or unfortunately, we all die, 
                            the idea is not to live forever, its to create something that does. I'd rather die for an idea that lives than to live 
                            for an idea that dies. Death is not terminal, it's serminal. Even when the Lord taketh away my breath, I pray that HKD will  live forever.
                              Now we get played on Trace Africa , Many thanks across the globe to the broadcasting stations. Special mentions Zim and UK radio stations.
                             HKD fans in China, Botswana, South Africa, UK, Mozambique, America, Canada, Australia  and in Zimbabwe will remember what I have shared with them. 
                             This is Just a confession from a humble goal getter (Slyvester) Freeman... UP UP UP.... DAAAAAAAANGERZONE
